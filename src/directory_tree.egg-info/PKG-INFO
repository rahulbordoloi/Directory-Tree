        ## About 
        
        Want to display your project/current working directory as a neat tree? No Worries!
        
        `Directory Tree` is a simple python utility package that displays out the Tree Structure of a user-defined directory.
        
        <b><i> Currently Available for All Platforms.  </i></b>
        
        ## Installation
        
        Run the following command on your terminal to install `directory_tree`: 
        
        1 .  Installing the package using `pip`:
        ```python
        pip install directory_tree
        ```
        OR
        
        ```python
        pip3 install directory_tree
        ```
        
        2 . Cloning the repository:
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/rahulbordoloi/Directory-Tree/
        cd Directory-Tree
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Run this script in order to print out the tree structure of a user-defined directory!
        
        ```python
        # Importing Libraries
        from directory_tree import display_tree
        
        # Main Method
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            display_tree(directory_path)
        ```
        
        *   Here by default, the `directory_path` is the current working directory (CWD) unless specified by the user.
        
        ## Output
        
        1. For <i>Current Working Directory</i> [DEFAULT]
        
        ```python
        >>> from directory_tree import display_tree
        >>> display_tree()
        
        $ Operating System : Windows
        $ Path : C:\Personal\Work\Directory-Tree\Test\Main Directory
        
        *************** Directory Tree ***************
        
        Main Directory/
        â”œâ”€â”€ Directory 1/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Directory 2/
        â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Directory 3/
        â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Directory 4/
        â”‚       â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Hello World.txt
        â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Say World.txt
        â”œâ”€â”€ Directory A/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Hmm.txt
        â”œâ”€â”€ directory-tree-print.cpp
        â”œâ”€â”€ letseee.txt
        â””â”€â”€ printTree.exe
        
        ```
        
        2. For <i>User Specified Directory</i> [Argument]
        
        ```python
        >>> from directory_tree import display_tree
        >>> display_tree('C:\Personal\Work\Directory-Tree\Test\Main Directory')
        
        $ Operating System : Windows
        $ Path : C:\Personal\Work\Directory-Tree\Test\Main Directory
        
        *************** Directory Tree ***************
        
        Main Directory/
        â”œâ”€â”€ Directory 1/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Directory 2/
        â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Directory 3/
        â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Directory 4/
        â”‚       â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Hello World.txt
        â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Say World.txt
        â”œâ”€â”€ Directory A/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Hmm.txt
        â”œâ”€â”€ directory-tree-print.cpp
        â”œâ”€â”€ letseee.txt
        â””â”€â”€ printTree.exe
        
        ```
        
        ## Developing `Directory Tree`
        
        To install `directory_tree`, along with the tools you need to develop and run tests, and execute the following in your virtualenv:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install -e .[dev]
        ```
        
        ## Security & Bugs
        
        *   `Directory Tree` uses recursion. It will raise a `RecursionError` on really deep directory trees.
        *   As the tree is lazily evaluated, it should behave well on really wide directory trees. Immediate children of a given directory are not lazily evaluated, though. It would be prompted to the last.
        *   Currently `Directory Tree` doesn't support the functionality of ignoring files/directories in a particular path, so will print every files-directories present in the given path.
        *   If you're a Windows user, it is always advised to use `\\` instead of `\` in the address as using `\` might catchup escape sequences and corrupt the address string.
